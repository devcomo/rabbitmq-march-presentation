# ComoRichWeb AMQP Demo
This is a quickly thrown together demo of how rabbitMQ works that I
threw together for [ComoRichWeb](http://comorichweb.posterous.com) March
meetup.

## Running It
First install and run rabbitmq, node.js and coffeescript. Then switch to
the project directory and run

```bash
npm install 
```

to gather all the dependencies. Run publisher.coffee to run the
publisher. Run even.coffee, odd.coffee or everything.coffee to use
different consumers. 

Have fun!
